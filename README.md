Inspired by some collaborative learning theories and some personal experiences and observations this semester, I become very interested in how to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of group workings.

### Self reflection:
We have drawn a design sketch on paper about what the website will look like and what features will it have. 
We plan to make a prototype of the main page first. 

### Future development:
