### Overall objective of this project:
Inspired by some collaborative learning theories and some personal experiences and observations this semester, I become very interested in how to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of group workings. During this semester, we are required to do a lot of group works and studies. We enjoyed the collaborative learning process a lot, students are able to brainstorm ideas together, share experiences and knowledge with each other, and because of the collaborative work, learning becomes interesting and full of potentials. More importantly, collaborative learning enables students to learn from each other.(Connectivism: “Learning does not simply happen within an individual, but within and across the networks.”) However, I found that sometimes students...Personal experience: When we have group projects in class, we are usually struggling with how to efficiently find our ideal group mates. Moreover, teachers may feel tricky to manage students’ grouping.

### Technical execution:
tech-stack:
Front-end: React (JS), React Router, Moment.js, React Bootstrap 
Back-end: Node, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB
deploy: npm
Firstly, I made a very basic website using HTML, CSS, JavaScipt, but lately I found that the user interface is not very aesthetic and it costs lines of codes to achieve a very basic function. So, I watched a lot of youtube tutorials and googled several examples via mainstream websites, like StackOverflow,  W3Schools. Many youtubers mentioned industrial standards about front-end development and recommended react for creating interactive UIs. So I turned to learn knowledge about react and how to develop a website with front-end and back-end.

### This is the project I finished so far:

### Self reflection:
We have drawn a design sketch on paper about what the website will look like and what features will it have. 
We plan to make a prototype of the main page first. 

### Future development:
