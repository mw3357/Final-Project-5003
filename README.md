# Final-Project-for-5003
## Final Project for 5003 Interactive Media 
## Teachers College, Columbia University

### Overall objective of this project:
Inspired by some collaborative learning theories and some personal experiences and observations this semester, I become very interested in how to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of group workings and improve collaborative learning experiences. One of the solutions that I come up with is that I can build a function in my website that allows students with different unique skills to be in a group, so they can utilize their different skills in one project, and learn other skills from each other. My website works for both teachers and students. Teachers can create assignments on the webstie and generate a link to share with students. Then students are able to join the assignment the teacher posted, and input their basic informations, especially their skills. The main function of my website is to auto-group the students that join the assignment, and let each group has as much as skills as they can.

### Design inspiration:
During this semester, we are required to do a lot of group works and studies. We enjoyed the collaborative learning process a lot, students are able to brainstorm ideas together, share experiences and knowledge with each other, and because of the collaborative work, learning becomes interesting and full of potentials. More importantly, collaborative learning enables students to learn from each other.
- Connectivism: “Learning does not simply happen within an individual, but within and across the networks.”
- The zone of proximal development (ZPD)： “The ability to solve problems independently and do certain tasks without help could be facilitated through social interaction and sense-making.”
### Technical execution:
- Front-end: React (JS), Moment.js, React Bootstrap 
- Back-end: Node.js, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB
- Firstly, I made a very basic website using HTML, CSS, JavaScipt, but lately I found that the user interface was not very aesthetic and it costed lines of codes to achieve a very basic function. So, I watched a lot of youtube tutorials and googled several examples via mainstream websites, like StackOverflow,  W3Schools. Many youtubers mentioned industrial standards about front-end development and recommended react for creating interactive UIs. So I turned to learn knowledge about react and learned to develop a website with front-end and back-end. I used React for developing the front-end, and for the back-end, I used Node, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB.  

- I found a tutorial for installing MongoDB on a Google Cloud node with easy setups : https://bluemedora.com/mongodb-on-google-cloud-how-to-set-it-up-and-keep-it-healthy/. The mongo endpoint is 34.87.52.51:27017.

### This is the project I finished so far:


### Self reflection:
- I spent 4 weeks to learn to use react and other basic knowledge about developing a interactive website with both front-end and back-end, but still find the timeline is pretty tight and stressful. If I could start over again, I would not spend much time on using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript to develop the old version of the website. Instead, I will spend more time on studying knowledge about React, Node, etc. and build websites based on the existed frameworks.
- What I find most interesting in my project is that I can create a presentable user interface and achieve real functions by using existed libraries and frameworks, which saves me a lot of time.   

### Future development:
- The delete function will be developed in the future, so the teacher can delete the information the students wrongly entered.
- Add log-in page for teachers and students
- Optimize the algorithm of auto-grouper function. For now, if the number of student is odd, then there will be a team with only one student.
